<p>
<h3><font color="black">What is Eureka Gallery? Eureka Gallery is an exhibition space to challenge your mind to think creatively and innovatively and get ready to shout ‚ÄúEureka!‚Äù when you successfully complete all the challenges in the Challenge Your Mind, Color and Sound, Illusion and All About Numbers zones.‚ú®</h3>

<h4><font color="peach">Figure 2: My picture in the Indoor Exhibition Gallery which is called Science Valley</h4>
</p>
<p>
<h3><font color="black">What is Science Valley? Science Valley, the newest gallery at the National Science Center, focuses on basic theories such as nature, physics, chemistry and biology that can be used by all ages.
Officiated by the Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad on 2 April 2019, in conjunction with the National Science Week 2019, opened the opportunity for the public to explore science in the form of hands - on, minds - on and interactive exhibitions.
In fact, the National Science Center also provides an interesting and fun simulated environment for visitors from various educational backgrounds as well as making it easier for them to understand the concepts of science presented in Science Valley.
Science Valley, which is only available on PSN, brings visitors to know and learn about the latest science issues as well as the application of science and technology in daily life.</h3>
